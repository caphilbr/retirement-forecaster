# Retirement Forecaster

## Summary

This web app allows a User to input their current retirement savings balances by account type (401k, Roth, Bank Acct, etc.) as well as their current annual savings, and see how well they are on track for retirement.

The app uses stochastic scenarios with variable yields on accounts, inflation, and salary raises. It also introduces a 'frugal' factor if savings are off-track, in an attempt to have savings last until death.
